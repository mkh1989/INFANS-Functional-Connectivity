# INFANS-Assessment of EEG microstates before and during seizures in full-term neonates
This repo contains the MATLAB scripts related to the assessment of neonatal brain dynamics before and during seizure events in full-term neonates.

This work is supported by the European Union under the H2020-EU.1.3.1 Program (European Training Networks Funding Scheme; INFANS Project “INtegrating Functional Assessment measures for Neonatal Safeguard”—G.A. nr. 813483).

The results of this study were presented at:
The 27th annual meeting of the Organization for Human Brain Mapping
